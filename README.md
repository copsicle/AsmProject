# The Amazing Assembly Project
Welcome to the project page.
I really don't know what I want my project to be yet but it needs to be something cool or a basic game.
This is on assembly 32 using LibDRD which is a "window manager" for assembly, LibDRD is on GitHub if you want the source code.
Also in this project I'm not allowed to use .if and other high level stuff.

# Requirements
The assembler is MASM32 which you can download somewhere on the internet.
I build the code on Visual Studio 2017, I also recommend downloading the AsmDude add-on.
You also need git for the git scripts (duh).
To make sure that you build this successfully in Visual Studio you have to do the following:
1. Create a new empty C++ project
2. Right click the project in the Solution Explorer -> Build Dependencies -> Build Customization's... ->
-> Put a tick on MASM -> OK (If you don't have MASM as an option you might've installed MASM incorrectly [or not at all])
3. Right click the project again -> Properties -> Linker -> System -> SubSystem -> Windows -> Press Apply and OK

 Meh.
